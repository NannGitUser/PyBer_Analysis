# Analysis of Rideshare Data for PyBer

## Overview: 
Good morning Omar and V. Using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib, I was able to dissect the past four months of rideshare data and find trends that might interest you. As you know, we collect a lot of data. I aggregated the data into drivers, fare totals, average far per driver and ride, dates of the rides, and area the service was rendered (urban, suburban, or rural area). 

### The Data

Here is the gist of business we do broken down by area. One thing of note is that while Urban areas produce roughly two-thirds of the rides and fares for PyBer, over 80% of our drivers work in urban areas. This market saturation means Urban PyBer drivers earn less per ride and much less overall. The average take home for an urban driver is only 29% of what another driver would take home in a rural setting. I believe we should encourage PyBer drivers that work in the cities to do business when possible in more suburban or rural setting. Things like 3 times that average take-home pay is a big incentive.

Suburban markets is a middleground between urban and rural settings. We could at least encourage Urban PyBer drivers to pick up passengers from the neighboring suburbs. They can operate where they always do, but there is a potential for more money if they are willing to go the extra mile. As you can see, the average fare for a ride in the suburb is 26% higher than in the city. A potential 26% increase in revenue per ride should be incentive. 

Looking at a very small section of data, we see that Urban Pyber drivers make the least amount of business around January-February. This is the ideal time to encourage them to diversify their business locations. In the beginning of January, they Urban drivers only generate 74% of what they would in the last week of April. When business is down, they would be more likely for suggestion.

## 3 Recommendations: 

Based on the Data, here are three easy things we could do to improve our business

* Encourage Urban PyBer Drivers to do business in suburban and rural settings for much more business
* Encourage Urban PyBer Drivers to accept rides from farther away, with a potential 26% increase in revenue
* An ideal time to encourage Urban PyBer Drivers to diversify their business is likely in January. 

I hope this presentation has been informative. Please let me know anything you would like further analysis of.
